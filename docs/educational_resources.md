# Educational Resources

The following material to support the Zynq RFSoC, and the RFSoC 2x2 has been developed by the University of Strathclyde in partnership with Xilinx. It consists of Jupyter notebooks that can be run on the RFSoC 2x2 board. 

## Introduction to RFSoC

* RFSoC Overview

* Software Defined Radio

* The RF Spectrum

### RFSoC Development with PYNQ

* System Development with RFSoC

* RF ADC Calibration Modes

* Dynamic Clock Configuration

* The RF DC Mixer

* RF DC Interpolation and Decimation

* RFSoC Nyquist Zones

 

## DSP for Wireless Communications

Additional material has been developed to support teaching of fundamental concepts and techniques for DSP design for wireless communications. The material consists of Jupyter notebooks that can be run on Jupyter running on your computer, or on any PYNQ enabled board.
