# RFSoC 2x2 kit

Xilinx’s Radio Frequency System-on-Chip ([RFSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html)) devices have created a new class of integrated circuit architecture for the communications and instrumentation markets. RFSoCs combine high-accuracy ADCs and DACs operating at Giga samples per second (Gsps), with programmable heterogeneous compute engines.

The [Xilinx University Program](https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/boards-portfolio/xup-boards/RFSoC2x2.html) is offering the **RFSoC 2x2 kit** exclusively for academic customers.

The kit features:

* $2,149<sup>*</sup> available only to academic customers 
* RFSoC 2x2 board with 2 RF DAC and 2 RF ADC channels
* [PYNQ framework](http://www.pynq.io) with Jupyter Lab for exceptional ease-of-use 
* Open-source resources including teaching materials, notebooks, and design examples  (see [Educational resources](./educational_resources.html))
* Complete end-to-end reference designs including spectrum analyzers and software defined radios (see [Overlays](overlays.html))
* [GitHub-hosted repositories](https://github.com/Xilinx/RFSoC2x2-PYNQ) of all project materials
* Online [PYNQ community support forum](https://discuss.pynq.io/)

For more details on the RFSoC 2x2 hardware, see the [Board Overview](overview.md) page.

<sup>*</sup>12 July 2021: The price has been updated due to substantial increases in component costs which have been widespread across the industry. This has added significant cost to the RFSoC 2x2. The impact on the price has been minimized with support from Xilinx and other board partners.

## Getting started

If you already have a board, go to the [RFSoC 2x2 Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide. The getting started guide includes instructions and a video showing you how to setup your board to run PYNQ. 

See the [XUP RFSoC 2x2 page](http://www.xilinx.com/support/university/boards-portfolio/xup-boards/RFSoC2x2.html) for details on how to apply to purchase an RFSoC 2x2.

## RFSoC 2x2 overlays and educational resources

Once your board is up and running, go to the [RFSoC 2x2 Overlays](./overlays.md) page for details about what you can do with your board, and how to build your own designs.

Review the [Educational resources](./educational_resources.html) and view the archived material including video and pdf presentations from the [ISFPGA 2021 RFSoC 2x2 tutorial](./tutorial.html).

## PYNQ community

For more information on what you can do with PYNQ, see the [PYNQ community](http://www.pynq.io/community.html) pages which showcases example PYNQ designs. You can check for any overlays that support the RFSoC 2x2, or try to port existing designs to your board.
