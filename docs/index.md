# RFSoC 2x2 kit

Xilinxâ€™s Radio Frequency System-on-Chip ([RFSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html)) devices have created a new class of integrated circuit architecture for the communications and instrumentation markets. RFSoCs combine high-accuracy ADCs- and DACs operating at Giga-samples per second, with programmable heterogeneous compute engines.

XUP is offering the **RFSoC 2x2 kit** exclusively for academic customers.

If you already have a board, go to the [RFSoC 2x2 Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide. The getting started guide includes instructions and a video showing you how to setup your board to run PYNQ. 

See the [XUP RFSoC 2x2 page](http://www.xilinx.com/support/university/boards-portfolio/xup-boards/RFSoC2x2.html) for details on how to purchase a RFSoC 2x2

## RFSoC 2x2 overlays

Once your board is up and running, go to the [RFSoC 2x2 Overlays](./overlays.md) page for details about what you can do with your board, and how to build your own designs.

## PYNQ community

For more information on what you can do with PYNQ, see the [PYNQ community](http://www.pynq.io/community.html) pages which showcases example PYNQ designs. You can check for any overlays that support the RFSoC 2x2, or try to port existing designs to your board.
