# RFSoC 2x2 ISFPGA tutorial

The RFSoC 2x2 tutorial (*Low-Cost Teaching and Research Platform Based on Xilinx RFSoC Technology and the PYNQ Framework*) was held at the ISFGPA Conference in February 2021. 

Speakers: Patrick Lysaght (Xilinx Research Labs), Prof. Robert W. Stewart (University of Strathclyde), David Brubaker (Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC product manager)

The tutorial covered an introduction to the RFSoC 2x2 platform and the PYNQ open-source framework. PYNQ provides a highly intuitive user system interface incorporating Linux, Python and Jupyter notebooks. It also comes with a suite of open-source teaching resources including videos, notebooks and design examples.

The benefits of integrating direct RF sampling data converters were demonstrated by introducing a novel, open-source spectrum analyzer built using the new board. This RFSoC design exploits advanced signal processing techniques, including higher-order Nyquist zones, to demonstrate performance that has only previously been achieved on very high-end instrumentation. Using the spectrum analyzer example, we will also demonstrate new approaches to the rapid prototyping of graphical user interfaces for research demonstrators.
